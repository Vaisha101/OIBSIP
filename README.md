# TASK 1: IRIS CLASSIFICATION
I obtained the Iris flower data set from Kaggle, which was created by Ronald Fisher in 1936. The dataset contains 150 samples, each measuring three species of Iris and consisting of four distinct features.
This project uses machine learning to predict Iris species based on data.
In this project, I utilized four machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM.

SVM IS GOOD MODEL FOR IRIS CLASSIFICATION AS COMPARED TO OTHERS

# TASK 2: UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN INDIA DURING COVID-19
The unemployment rate is calculated as the percentage of people who are currently without a job compared to the total workforce. Due to the impact of Covid-19, there has been a significant rise in the unemployment rate. Therefore, analyzing the unemployment rate could be a great data science project.
