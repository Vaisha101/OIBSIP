Data science Internship

# TASK 1: IRIS CLASSIFICATION
I obtained the Iris flower data set from Kaggle, which was originally created by Ronald Fisher in 1936. The dataset contains 150 samples, each measuring three species of Iris and consisting of four distinct features.
This project uses machine learning to predict Iris species based on data.
In this project, I utilized four machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM.
